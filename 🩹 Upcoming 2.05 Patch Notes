# RAHE SPEAKERS:
A full-featured, location-based music system for your server, packed with everything you'd expect and more. With our speaker system, you can carry the speaker with you, attach it to vehicles (now with visually attached speakers), queue music, access music history, set up permanent or public speakers with configurable logging.

## Features:
__**Spatial audio**__
- Spatial audio simulates how sound works in the real world, making it possible to hear sounds differently based on your position relative to the speaker(s). This means that players will hear the music or audio differently depending on where they are - whether they‚Äôre standing close, far away, or behind the speakers. This adds depth and realism, making events like house parties or car meets feel more lifelike.
__**Configurability**__
- You can effortlessly add new speaker models using the provided configuration options. Each model can have its own customizable max range, filters, volume settings and much more. For example, a basic boombox can have a shorter range, while a large club speaker can cover a much larger area. The choice is yours, and it‚Äôs easy to configure to suit your needs.
__**Music on the move**__
- You can carry the speakers wherever you go, as they can be attached to your character and the music will follow. Alternatively, you can attach it to a vehicle, either with the speaker hidden or using the gizmo system to visually display the speaker on the vehicle. This way, the music follows the vehicle instead of your character, adding flexibility to how you set up your sound. 
__**Speaker groups**__
- With the speaker group system, you can connect and synchronize different speakers. For large-scale events like concerts or festivals, you can create groups with bass-heavy speakers near the stage, filling the space with deep, immersive sound, while adding more balanced speakers around the area for clarity.  For car meets or cruising with friends, speaker groups enable you to sync speakers across multiple vehicles, so everyone hears the same music at the same time, no matter how far apart you are. It enhances the sense of togetherness and creates a dynamic atmosphere. By organizing speakers into groups based on location, type, or preference, the system offers a flexible, immersive, and perfectly synchronized audio experience, elevating events to a new level.
__**Filters**__
- To take your audio experience even further, our speaker system allows you to apply various filters to each speaker, letting you fine-tune the sound to match your needs. Whether you're looking to emphasize deep bass at a concert or sharpen the treble for clear vocals, filters such as lowpass, highshelf, and bandpass (and many more) give you precise control over the audio output. These filters allow you to craft the perfect sound profile for any event, ensuring that every note, beat, and effect is heard exactly as intended, creating a more immersive and professional audio environment.

# TRUCKING JOB:
A full trucking system for your server. Includes skills, convoys, dynamic job generation and more.

## Features:
__**Skill Advancement System**__
- As you progress in the game, you'll earn valuable skill points that open the door to five skills, each with six levels of proficiency. These skills serve as a gateway to exciting new job opportunities, enabling you to gain more money and experience.
__**Quick Jobs / Freight Jobs**__
- Jobs are categorized into two types: quick jobs, where the vehicle is provided, and freight jobs, requiring you to own or acquire a truck. No constraints on starting points; all jobs can start and end anywhere on the map.
__**Convoy - Journey Together with Friends**__
- Ability to complete jobs alongside friends. Utilize the lobby system to invite or remove members, and check job progress for convoy members in the jobs tab.
__**Vehicles**__
- Players have the opportunity to unlock custom trucks as they complete more jobs.
__**Dashboard**__
- Track your accomplishments with ease. The dashboard provides insights into completed jobs, total kilometers driven, and details of your last five assignments. Stay motivated by keeping an eye on your progress toward the next level.
__**Leaderboard / User Profile**__
- Measure your success against others on the leaderboard. Compare stats such as completed jobs, distance covered and rank. Customize your user profile with a unique name and picture to stand out.

# LATION METH:
Featuring two engaging and immersive meth crafting experiences - portable tables & purchasable meth labs! With a built-in experience system, extreme configurability & much more; there is a lot to enjoy here.

## Features:
‚ò¢Ô∏è __**Tables**__
- Who needs a meth van when you got a portable table? Start your meth manufacturing business by placing the table in your house, outside, or anywhere you want! Tables remain persistent through server restarts, logouts, etc. Completely control where tables are placed with optional collision and soil checking features & more.
üò∑ __**Gas Mask**__
- Cooking meth on a portable table is awesome but comes with it drawbacks. One of those is during the heating stage in which the tables give off a dangerous toxic chemical making breathing near the table difficult and if you are not equipped properly, could kill you! Equip yourself with the included Gas Mask to protect yourself during these dangerous phases.
üè† __**Meth Lab**__
- Take your meth manufacturing business to the next level and visit the dealer that has connects to various meth labs for sale around the city. For the right price you can purchase your own manufacturing facility and start producing larger quantities. Be sure to put some money aside for upgrades after you've purchased it - all the necessary manufacturing & security equipment is sold separately!
üìà __**Upgrading Meth Labs**__
- Once you become a proud owner of one of the exclusive & limited supply meth labs (don't worry, you can make as many or as few as you wish), you're going to need to purchase manufacturing equipment to get started with production. These upgrades takes (a configurable amount of) time, but will include all the necessary equipment, tanks and stash(es)! There are 3 upgrade options: basic manufacturing equipment, security equipment & once you own the basic manufacturing equipment, you can purchase the "upgraded" equipment for not only a cleaner look but even faster production.
üì¶ __**Supply Runs**__
- But before you do any of that - you need supplies! Meet with a suspicious man in a secluded location and he may (or may not) ask for something in exchange for his connects to various suppliers throughout the city! Drive around collecting crates of supplies you can later open and store for meth production later (this is an optional feature if you'd prefer supplies be given in a different way).
üíº __**Stashes**__
- Stashes are always useful. Each lab's "basic" upgrade includes a stash, but you can assign any number of stashes to any specific labs of your choice. Make other labs more enticing to buy than the rest! But, they also play a vital role. Your manufacturing equipment, once done producing a batch of meth will automatically place the finished tray of cooled meth into your stash, ready to be processed when you are.
üìπ __**Security Upgrade**__
- One of the benefits of purchasing the security upgrade for your meth lab is the inclusion of a security camera! Get a live feed view of your front door with panning, zooming & fully customizable. The security upgrade also comes with other benefits such as the basics you would expect like door locks but also includes the ability to secure your stash(es)! Set a pin that can be shared with others, so only those you want can access it. Reset or remove your pin at any time.
üôé __**Authorized Users**__
- Completely control who has access to your lab by utilizing the Authorized Users feature! If you own the security upgrade you can simply lock your door to restrict any public access, but you might want to give gang members, friends or other people special access, allowing them to enter whenever they want!
üí∞ __**Selling & Transferring**__
- Did your meth manufacturing business not turn out as well as you had envisioned? No worries, call it quits at any time and sell your warehouse to the state for a configurable amount, based on the purchase price of that warehouse. Don't want to sell too cheap to the state? Find a buyer and transfer ownership to them!
üìä __**Leveling System**__
- There's nothing more rewarding to your players than an experience/leveling system. Comes included with 10 different levels (you can add or remove levels). Customize the complete experience system, yields and benefits of each level to your liking to keep your players engaged and rewarded for their time.
üö® __**Police Raids**__
- There is a ton of criminal activity going on with meth manufacturing and the police are aware of it. As they build a case on you, watch out - they may raid your lab when you least expect it and confiscate all your manufacturing & security equipment requiring you to start over (this is an optional feature).
‚ö° __**Power Surges**__
- When manufacturing meth in your lab, be careful! Powering on the powerful equipment at the start of a production can cause a power surge that will result in the police being notified of a power surge in the area (this is an optional feature)!
üß™ __**Consumable Meth**__
- Why cook meth if you can't enjoy the fruits of your labor? Completely customize tons of unique consumable benefits of meth from adding health, armor, increased run speed, screen shakes, walk styles & even a chance to overdose! Each & every benefit can be individually toggled on or off, as well as all amounts, durations & similar can be adjusted completely to your liking.
üìä __**Performance**__
- Both client and server sided performance is vital to a successful server. We've spent countless hours optimizing and refining the ins-and-outs of this script to ensure servers of all sizes can enjoy our powerful meth crafting script without issue!
